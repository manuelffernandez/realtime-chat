## Run locally

#### NodeJS

For this project I used v18.18.0 of NodeJS. There is a _.nvmrc_ file to select the correct version with **nvm**.
To do this in Windows open a PowerShell terminal in the projects root directory and run `nvm use $(Get-Content .nvmrc)`.
In Linux or Mac, open a terminal in the project directory and run `nvm use`.

If you don't have nvm installed in your computer, ensure that you have that specific node version. You can check your Node version by running `node -v` in a terminal.

#### <sub>See [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm) or [nvm-windows](https://github.com/coreybutler/nvm-windows) for more info.</sub>

#### Packages

Once you ensure that you have the correct Node version, open a terminal inside the projects root directory and run `npm install`

#### Dev server

Run the development server:

```bash
/project-route npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

#### Scripts
